Goal-Oriented Representation of Scientific Papers - dataset


This repository contains the dataset described in: Goal-Oriented Representation of Scientific Papers.

Annotation was done for three domains. Each folder contains the following file types: 
	- *.ann files: annotation files in BRAT format 
	- *.txt files: the text on which the annotations where made.
	
There are two types of annotations:
	- Paper-based : summarization, and machine translation folders
	- Abstract-based: matching

The maps of all the annotations are found under maps, and have the same name as that of the txt/ann file.
