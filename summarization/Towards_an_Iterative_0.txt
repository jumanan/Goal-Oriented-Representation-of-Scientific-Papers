Towards an Iterative Reinforcement Approach for Simultaneous Document Summarization and Keyword Extraction
Single-document summarization and multi-document summarization are very closely related tasks and they have been widely investigated independently. This paper examines the mutual influences between the two tasks and proposes a novel unified approach to simultaneous single-document and multi-document summarizations. The mutual influences between the two tasks are incorporated into a graph model and the ranking scores of a sentence for the two tasks can be obtained in a unified ranking process. Experimental results on the benchmark DUC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for both single-document and multi-document summarizations.
