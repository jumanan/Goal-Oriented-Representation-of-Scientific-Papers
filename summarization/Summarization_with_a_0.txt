Summarization with a Joint Model for Sentence Extraction and Compression
Text summarization is one of the oldest problems in natural language processing. Popular approaches rely on extracting relevant sentences from the original documents. As a side effect, sentences that are too long but partly relevant are doomed to either not appear in the final summary, or prevent inclusion of other relevant sentences. Sentence compression is a recent framework that aims to select the shortest subsequence of words that yields an informative and grammatical sentence. This work proposes a one-step approach for document summarization that jointly performs sentence extraction and compression by solving an integer linear program. We report favorable experimental results on newswire data.
