The Karlsruhe Institute of Technology Translation Systems for the WMT 2011
This paper describes the phrase-based SMT systems developed for our participation in the WMT11 Shared Translation Task. Translations for English↔German and English↔French were generated using a phrase-based translation system which is extended by additional models such as bilingual and fine-grained POS language models, POS-based reordering, lattice phrase extraction and discriminative word alignment. Furthermore, we present a special filtering method for the English-French Giga corpus and the phrase scoring step in the training is parallelized.
