Formemes in English-Czech Deep Syntactic MT
One of the most notable recent improvements of the TectoMT English-to-Czech translation is a systematic and theoretically supported revision of formemesâ€”the annotation of morpho-syntactic features of content words in deep dependency syntactic structures based on the Prague tectogrammatics theory.Our modifications aim at reducing data sparsity, increasing consistency across languages and widening the usage area of this markup.Formemes can be used not only in MT, but in various other NLP tasks.
