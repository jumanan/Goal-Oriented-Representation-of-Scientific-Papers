A New Method Based on Tree Simplification and Schema Matching for Automatic Web Result Extraction and Matching
In this paper, a new method proposed for extracting and matching the Search Result Record (SRR) data items from different search engines. The method first detects SRRs for a given Web search result. Afterwards, an SRR simplification algorithm is devised to deal with complexity of SRR Document Object Model (DOM) Trees. SRRs and their data items (or properties) are extracted after simplification. Data items are normalized in local and global domain as a last step. Experimental results show that the proposed methods are successful in extracting and merging the SRRs.
