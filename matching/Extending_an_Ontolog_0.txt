Extending an Ontology Alignment System with a Lexical Database
Ontology alignment is a challenging problem which limits or even prevents interoperability among information systems. It aims to find semantic correspondences between a pair of input ontologies with a view to making them semantically interoperable. One product of ontology alignment research is Falcon Aligning Ontologies (Falcon-AO), a system that attempts to align a pair of input ontologies automatically. This paper developed and implemented an enhanced version of Falcon-AO with increased precision. The enhanced system makes use of a large lexical database, WordNet, in the alignment process. Performance of the extended Falcon-AO system was tested and validated using standard benchmark ontologies from the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative. Comparative performance analysis of the original and extended.
