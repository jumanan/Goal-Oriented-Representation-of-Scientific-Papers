Locality-Sensitive Hashing for Massive String-Based Ontology Matching
This paper reports initial research results related to the use of locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) for string-based matching of big ontologies. Two ways of transforming the matching problem into a LSH problem are proposed and experimental results are reported. The performed experiments show that using LSH for ontology matching could lead to a very fast matching process. The quality of the alignment achieved in these experiments is comparable to state-of-the-art matchers, but much faster. Further research is needed to find out whether the use of different metrics or specific hardware would improve the results.
