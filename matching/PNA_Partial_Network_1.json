"{\"paper\": {\"status\": \"map_review\", \"title\": \"PNA: Partial Network Alignment with Generic Stable Matching\", \"url\": \"http://disi.unitn.it/~pavel/OM/articles/2015_iri_paper.pdf\", \"abstract\": \"To enjoy more social network services, users nowadays are usually involved in multiple online social networks simultaneously. The shared users between different networks are called anchor users, while the remaining unshared users are named as non-anchor users. Connections between accounts of anchor users in different networks are defined as anchor links and networks partially aligned by anchor links can be represented as partially aligned networks. In this paper, we want to predict anchor links between partially aligned social networks, which is formally defined as the partial network alignment problem. The partial network alignment problem is very difficult to solve because of the following two challenges: (1) the lack of general features for anchor links, and (2) the \\u201cone - to - one\\u2264\\u201d (one to at most one) constraint on anchor links. To address these two challenges, a new method PNA (Partial Network Aligner) is proposed in this paper. PNA (1) extracts various adjacency scores among users across networks based on a set of internetwork anchor meta paths, and (2) utilizes the generic stable matching to identify the non-anchor users to prune the redundant anchor links attached to them. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world partially aligned social networks demonstrate that PNA can solve the partial network alignment problem very well and outperform all the other comparison methods with significant advantages.\", \"field\": \"Data Mining; Partial Network Alignment; Multiple Heterogeneous Social Networks\", \"rdf\": \"PNA_Partial_Network_0.rdf\", \"user\": \"matching\"}, \"map_name\": \"PNA_Partial_Network_1.html\", \"_id\": {\"$oid\": \"5a4f45f7180e1115783ec720\"}, \"annotation\": {\"metrics\": [{\"type\": \"Qualitative\", \"name\": \"anchor users -
