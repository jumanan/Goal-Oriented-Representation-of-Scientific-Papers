Mapping of Semantic Web Ontology in User Query System
The main purpose of the Semantic Web promises a kind Machine Intelligence, which can support a verity of user tasks like efficiency of search engine or Question Answering (QA). Ontologies are needed for realization of the semantic web, which in turn depends on the ability of system to identify and take advantage of relationships that exist within ontologies. There are huge numbers of ontologies present on the web they need to be integrated for data integration. These ontologies are having different in representation, quality of data and larger sizes of ontologies, this lead to be problem during ontology mapping, on analyzing these problems and to introduce Multiagent mapping system. Main aim is to achieve heterogeneous data integration through semantic mapping of ontologies. this paper provide a mapping framework for Multiagent ontology having heterogeneous data in Semantic web and develop a question answering system from developed framework of ontologyâ€™s and improve performance by adding semantic relation interpreter which improves response time.
