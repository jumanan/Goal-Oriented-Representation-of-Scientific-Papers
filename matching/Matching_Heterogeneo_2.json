"{\"paper\": {\"status\": \"map_review\", \"title\": \"Matching Heterogeneous Events with Patterns\", \"url\": \"http://disi.unitn.it/~p2p/RelatedWork/Matching/14icde_zhu.pdf\", \"abstract\": \"A large amount of heterogeneous event data are increasingly generated, e.g., in online systems for Web services or operational systems in enterprises. Owing to the difference between event data and traditional relational data, the matching of heterogeneous events is highly non-trivial. While event names are often opaque (e.g., merely with obscure IDs), the existing structure-based matching techniques for relational data also fail to perform owing to the poor discriminative power of dependency relationships between events. We note that interesting patterns exist in the occurrence of events, which may serve as discriminative features in event matching. In this paper, we formalize the problem of matching events with patterns. A generic pattern based matching framework is proposed, which is compatible with the existing structure based techniques. To improve the matching efficiency, we devise several bounds of matching scores for pruning. Recognizing the NP-hardness of the optimal event matching problem with patterns, we propose efficient heuristic. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our pattern based matching compared with approaches adapted from existing techniques, and the efficiency improved by the bounding, pruning and heuristic methods.\", \"field\": \"Schema matching; event matching\", \"rdf\": \"Matching_Heterogeneo_0.rdf\", \"user\": \"matching\"}, \"map_name\": \"Matching_Heterogeneo_2.html\", \"_id\": {\"$oid\": \"5a47e26e0b95e62dac4d8892\"}, \"annotation\": {\"metrics\": [{\"type\": \"Qualitative\", \"name\": \"matching of heterogeneous events_performance\", \"task_name\": {\"name\": \"matching of heterogeneous events\"}, \"measure\": \"performance\"}, {\"name\": \"matching of heterogeneous events_effectiveness\", \"task_name\": {\"name\": \"matching of heterogeneous events\"}, \"measure\": \"effectiveness\"}], \"tasks\": [{\"name\": \"matching of heterogeneous events\"}, {\"name\": \"matching relational data\"}, {\"name\": \"structure-based matching techniques\"}, {\"name\": \"patterns exist in the occurrence of events - pattern based matching framework\"}, {\"name\": \"discriminative features\"}, {\"name\": \"this paper\"}, {\"name\": \"pruning\"}, {\"name\": \"bounds of matching scores\"}], \"datasets\": [], \"results\": [{\"value\": \"-\", \"metric_name\": {\"type\": \"Qualitative\", \"name\": \"matching of heterogeneous events_performance\", \"task_name\": {\"name\": \"matching of heterogeneous events\"}, \"measure\": \"performance\"}, \"dataset_name\": \"\", \"task_name\": {\"name\": \"structure-based matching techniques\"}}, {\"value\": \"+\", \"metric_name\": {\"name\": \"matching of heterogeneous events_effectiveness\", \"task_name\": {\"name\": \"matching of heterogeneous events\"}, \"measure\": \"effectiveness\"}, \"dataset_name\": \"\", \"task_name\": {\"name\": \"this paper\"}}], \"relations\": [{\"task1_name\": {\"name\": \"matching relational data\"}, \"task2_name\": {\"name\": \"structure-based matching techniques\"}, \"relation_type\": \"is achieved by\"}, {\"task1_name\": {\"name\": \"discriminative features\"}, \"task2_name\": {\"name\": \"patterns exist in the occurrence of events - pattern based matching framework\"}, \"relation_type\": \"is achieved by\"}, {\"task1_name\": {\"name\": \"matching of heterogeneous events\"}, \"task2_name\": {\"name\": \"discriminative features\"}, \"relation_type\": \"is achieved by\"}, {\"task1_name\": {\"name\": \"patterns exist in the occurrence of events - pattern based matching framework\"}, \"task2_name\": {\"name\": \"this paper\"}, \"relation_type\": \"is achieved by\"}, {\"task1_name\": {\"name\": \"pruning\"}, \"task2_name\": {\"name\": \"bounds of matching scores\"}, \"relation_type\": \"is achieved by\"}, {\"task1_name\": {\"name\": \"pruning\"}, \"task2_name\": {\"name\": \"this paper\"}, \"relation_type\": \"is a subtask of\"}]}, \"time\": \" 12/30/2017, 9:10:06 PM\"}"
