These  can  even  be  found  within  a  single  dataset.  In  this  paper  we  propose  a method for automatic discovery of identity relationship between two entities (also known as instance matching) in a dataset represented as a graph (e.g. in the Linked Data Cloud). Our method can be used for cleaning existing datasets from duplicates, validating of existing identity relationships between entities within a dataset, or for connecting different\\ndatasets using the owl:sameAs relationship. Our method is based on the  analysis of sub-graphs formed by entities, their properties and existing  relationships between them. It can learn a common similarity threshold for particular dataset, so it is adaptable to its different properties. We evaluated our method by conducting several experiments on data from the domains of public administration and digital libraries.\", \"field\": \"duplicates; identity; similarity; relationship; Semantic Web; owl:sameAs; Linked Data; Web of Data\", \"rdf\": \"Detecting_Identical__0.rdf\", \"user\": \"matching\"}, \"map_name\": \"Detecting_Identical__2.html\", \"_id\": {\"$oid\": \"5a22ca8a36a95c46b21ed056\"}, \"annotation\": {\"metrics\": [{\"type\": \"Qualitative\", \"name\": \"automatic discovery of identity relationship between two entities - instance matching_adaptability\", \"task_name\": {\"name\": \"automatic discovery of identity relationship between two entities - instance matching\"}, \"measure\": \"adaptability\"}], \"tasks\": [{\"name\": \"automatic discovery of identity relationship between two entities - instance matching\"}, {\"name\": \"this_paper - we - this paper\"}, {\"name\": \"cleaning existing datasets from duplicates\"}, {\"name\": \"validating of existing identity relationships between entities within a dataset\"}, {\"name\": \"connecting different datasets using the owl:sameAs relationship\"}, {\"name\": \"analysis of sub-graphs formed by entities, their properties and existing relationships between them\"}, {\"name\": \"learn a common similarity threshold for particular dataset\"}], \"datasets\": [], \"results\": [{\"dataset_name\": \"\", \"metric_name\": {\"type\": \"Qualitative\", \"name\": \"automatic discovery of identity relationship between two entities - instance matching_adaptability\", \"task_name\": {\"name\": \"automatic discovery of identity relationship between two entities - instance matching\"}, \"measure\": \"adaptability\"}, \"value\": \"+\", \"task_name\": {\"name\": \"this_paper - we - this paper\"}}], \"relations\": [{\"task1_name\": {\"name\": \"automatic discovery of identity relationship between two entities - instance matching\"}, \"task2_name\": {\"name\": \"this_paper - we - this paper\"}, \"relation_type\": \"is achieved by\"}, {\"task1_name\": {\"name\": \"cleaning existing datasets from duplicates\"}, \"task2_name\": {\"name\": \"automatic discovery of identity relationship between two entities - instance matching\"}, \"relation_type\": \"is achieved by\"}, {\"task1_name\": {\"name\": \"validating of existing identity relationships between entities within a dataset\"}, \"task2_name\": {\"name\": \"automatic discovery of identity relationship between two entities - instance matching\"}, \"relation_type\": \"is achieved by\"}, {\"task1_name\": {\"name\": \"connecting different datasets using the owl:sameAs relationship\"}, \"task2_name\": {\"name\": \"automatic discovery of identity relationship between two entities - instance matching\"}, \"relation_type\": \"is achieved by\"}, {\"task1_name\": {\"name\": \"this_paper - we - this paper\"}, \"task2_name\": {\"name\": \"analysis of sub-graphs formed by entities, their properties and existing relationships between them\"}, \"relation_type\": \"is achieved by\"}, {\"task1_name\": {\"name\": \"learn a common similarity threshold for particular dataset\"}, \"task2_name\": {\"name\": \"this_paper - we - this paper\"}, \"relation_type\": \"is achieved by\"}]}, \"time\": \" 3/4/2018, 9:52:12 AM\"}"
