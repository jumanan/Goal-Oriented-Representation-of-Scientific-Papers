The \\nproblem  of  ontology  alignment  is  defined  as  identifying  the  relationship  shared  by  the  set  of  different  entities  where each entity  belongs to separate ontology. The amount of similarity between two entities from two different ontologies takes part into the ontology alignment process. There are several similarity measuring methods available in the existing literature   for   measuring   the   similarity   between   two   discrete   entities   from   different ontologies.   To   obtain   a comprehensive  and  precise  result,  all  the  similarity  measures  are  integrated.  One  of  the  ways  to  combine  the  various similarity  measures  is  weight-based  similarity  aggregation.  Usually  the  weights  with  respect  to  various  similarity measures  are  assigned  manually  or  through  some  method.  But  most  of  the  existing  techniques  suffer  from  lack  of optimality.  Also  many  evolutionary  based  approaches  are  available  to  find  the  optimal  solution  for  weight-based similarity  aggregation  but  they are  designed  as  single  objective  optimization  problem.  This  fact  has  inspired  us  to develop  a  multiobjective  particle  swarm  based  optimization  algorithm  for  generating  optimal  weight  based  similarity aggregation to get a optimal alignment. In this article, two objectives precision and recall are simultaneously optimized. Moreover  a  local  search  is  conducted  for  replacing  the  worst  population  in  the  new  generation  by  best  population acquired from the history. The proposed study is evaluated using an artificial data set and performance of the proposed method is compared with that of its single objective versions.\", \"field\": \"ontology alignment, particle swarm optimization, multiobjective optimization\", \"rdf\": \"Aggregated_Similarit_0.rdf\", \"user\": \"matching\"}, \"map_name\": \"Aggregated_Similarit_2.html\", \"_id\": {\"$oid\": \"5a4396420b95e62dac4d8884\"}, \"annotation\": {\"metrics\": [], \"tasks\": [{\"name\": \"conceptualize information that is published in electronic format\"}, {\"name\": \"ontology\"}, {\"name\": \"ontology  alignment\"}, {\"name\": \"similarity between two entities\"}, {\"name\": \"combine  the  various similarity  measures\"}, {\"name\": \"weight-based  similarity  aggregation\"}, {\"name\": \"evolutionary  based  approaches\"}, {\"name\": \"find the  optimal  solution  for  weight-based similarity  aggregation\"}, {\"name\": \"single objective optimization problem\"}, {\"name\": \"multiobjective  particle  swarm  based  optimization  algorithm\"}], \"datasets\": [], \"results\": [], \"relations\": [{\"task1_name\": {\"name\": \"conceptualize information that is published in electronic format\"}, \"task2_name\": {\"name\": \"ontology\"}, \"relation_type\": \"is achieved by\"}, {\"task1_name\": {\"name\": \"ontology  alignment\"}, \"task2_name\": {\"name\": \"similarity between two entities\"}, \"relation_type\": \"is achieved by\"}, {\"task1_name\": {\"name\": \"combine  the  various similarity  measures\"}, \"task2_name\": {\"name\": \"weight-based  similarity  aggregation\"}, \"relation_type\": \"is achieved by\"}, {\"task1_name\": {\"name\": \"find the  optimal  solution  for  weight-based similarity  aggregation\"}, \"task2_name\": {\"name\": \"single objective optimization problem\"}, \"relation_type\": \"is achieved by\"}, {\"task1_name\": {\"name\": \"single objective optimization problem\"}, \"task2_name\": {\"name\": \"evolutionary  based  approaches\"}, \"relation_type\": \"is achieved by\"}, {\"task1_name\": {\"name\": \"find the  optimal  solution  for  weight-based similarity  aggregation\"}, \"task2_name\": {\"name\": \"multiobjective  particle  swarm  based  optimization  algorithm\"}, \"relation_type\": \"is achieved by\"}, {\"task1_name\": {\"name\": \"similarity between two entities\"}, \"task2_name\": {\"name\": \"combine  the  various similarity  measures\"}, \"relation_type\": \"is achieved by\"}, {\"task1_name\": {\"name\": \"find the  optimal  solution  for  weight-based similarity  aggregation\"}, \"task2_name\": {\"name\": \"combine  the  various similarity  measures\"}, \"relation_type\": \"is a subtask of\"}]}, \"time\": \" 3/18/2018, 6:07:11 PM\"}"
