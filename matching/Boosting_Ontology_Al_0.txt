Boosting Ontology Alignment Extraction with flow theory
Ontology matching is a key interoperability enabler for the Semantic Web since it takes the ontologies as input and determines as output correspondences between the semantically related entities of those ontologies. We present in this paper a graph based approach to tackle the ontology matching problem. The objective is to address the combinatorial aspects related to this issue. More precisely, our approach consists in modeling the problem of extracting an alignment (matching) which satisfies a cardinality constraints, as minimizing some cost on feasible flow problem defined on a bipartite graph. The found solution represents the best alignment which maximizes the global similarity between the entities of the two ontologies.
