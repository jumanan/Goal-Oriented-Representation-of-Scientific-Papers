Many applications today call for the management and query capabilities directly on graphs. Real time graph streams, as seen in road networks, social and communication networks, and web requests, are such applications. Event pattern matching requires the awareness of graph structures, which is different from traditional complex event processing. It also requires a focus on the dynamicity of the graph, time order constraints in patterns, and online query processing, which deviates significantly from previous work on subgraph matching as well. We study the semantics and efficient online algorithms for this important and intriguing problem, and evaluate our approaches with extensive experiments over real world datasets in four different domains.\", \"rdf\": \"Event_Pattern_Matchi_0.rdf\", \"user\": \"matching\"}, \"map_name\": \"Event_Pattern_Matchi_2.html\", \"_id\": {\"$oid\": \"5a46a18f0b95e62dac4d888e\"}, \"annotation\": {\"metrics\": [], \"tasks\": [{\"name\": \"pattern matching\"}, {\"name\": \"graph structures\"}, {\"name\": \"online query processing\"}, {\"name\": \"Event pattern matching\"}, {\"name\": \"subgraph matching\"}], \"datasets\": [], \"results\": [], \"relations\": [{\"task1_name\": {\"name\": \"graph structures\"}, \"task2_name\": {\"name\": \"Event pattern matching\"}, \"relation_type\": \"is a subtask of\"}, {\"task1_name\": {\"name\": \"pattern matching\"}, \"task2_name\": {\"name\": \"Event pattern matching\"}, \"relation_type\": \"is achieved by\"}, {\"selected\": false, \"task1_name\": {\"name\": \"online query processing\"}, \"task2_name\": {\"name\": \"Event pattern matching\"}, \"relation_type\": \"is a subtask of\"}]}, \"time\": \" 12/29/2017, 10:08:09 PM\"}"
