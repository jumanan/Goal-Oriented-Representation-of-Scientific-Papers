The Role of Analogy in Ontology Alignment: A Study on LISA
Ontologies are explicit specifications of concepts and their relationships. In the context of a semantic web of independently developed ontologies, overcoming interoperability and heterogeneity issues is of considerable importance. Many semantic web applications, such as matching of instances in social networks, reasoning over combined knowledge bases, and knowledge sharing among services, rely on ontology alignment. While existing research in this area has developed a wide range of different heuristics, in this paper we propose to look towards cognitive science, specifically analogical reasoning, to support ontology alignment. We investigate the question whether ontology alignment is rooted in the same cognitive process as analogical reasoning. We apply the LISA system, a cognitively-based model of human analogical reasoning, to ontology alignment and present a comprehensive experimental study to determine its performance on ontology alignment problems.
