HARPY: Hypernyms and Alignment of Relational Paraphrases
Collections of relational paraphrases have been automatically constructed from large text corpora, as a WordNet counterpart for the realm of binary predicates and their surface forms. However, these resources fall short in their coverage of hypernymy links (subsumptions) among the synsets of phrases. This paper closes this gap by computing a high-quality alignment between the relational phrases of the Patty taxonomy, one of the largest collections of this kind, and the verb senses of WordNet. To this end, we devise judicious features and develop a graph-based alignment algorithm by adapting and extending the SimRank random-walk method. The resulting taxonomy of relational phrases and verb senses, coined HARPY, contains 20,812 synsets organized into a DAG with 616,792 hypernymy links. Our empirical assessment, indicates that the alignment links between Patty and WordNet have high accuracy, with MRR score 0.7 and NDCG score 0.73. As an additional extrinsic value, HARPY provides fine-grained lexical types for the arguments of verb senses in WordNet.
