Frame-Based Ontology Alignment
The need of handling semantic heterogeneity of resources is a key problem of the Semantic Web. State of the art techniques for ontology matching are the key technology for addressing this issue. However, they only partially exploit the natural language descriptions of ontology entities and they are mostly unable to find correspondences between entities having different logical types (e.g. mapping properties to classes). We introduce a novel approach aimed at finding correspondences between ontology entities according to the intensional meaning of their models, hence abstracting from their logical types. Lexical linked open data and frame semantics play a crucial role in this proposal. We argue that this approach may lead to a step ahead in the state of the art of ontology matching, and positively affect related applications such as question answering and knowledge reconciliation.
